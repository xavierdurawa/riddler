    "_You are placing many, many dominoes in a straight line, one at a time. However, each time you place a domino, there is a 1 percent chance that you accidentally tip it over, causing a chain reaction that tips over all dominoes you’ve placed. After a chain reaction, you start over again._\n",
    "\n",
    "_If you do this many, many times, what can you expect the median (note: not the average) number of dominoes placed when a chain reaction occurs (including the domino that causes the chain reaction)? More precisely, if this median number is M, then you would expect to have placed fewer than M dominoes at most half the time, and more than M dominoes at most half the time._"
