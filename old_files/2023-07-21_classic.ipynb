    "# Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "_This week’s puzzle is an oldie but a goodie, and comes from high school student Meryl Zhang of Plano, Texas, who was named the top math awardee at this year’s Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair. For her project, Meryl developed novel heuristics for the NP-hard partition problem. Meryl enjoys K-dramas, including Squid Game—a show that has already proven ripe for riddles._\n",
    "\n",
    "_This week, the final 20 players in the Squid Game competition form a circle and are assigned the whole numbers from 1 to 20, progressing in a clockwise direction. First, contestant 2 is eliminated. Then, the contestant two positions clockwise from where 2 was (i.e., contestant 4) is eliminated. Next, the contestant two positions clockwise from them (i.e., contestant 6) is eliminated. The counting continues in this manner, wrapping around the circle, which tightens after each elimination. So after contestant 20 is eliminated, the next contestant to go is 3, who at this point is two positions clockwise from where 20 once stood._\n",
    "\n",
    "_You repeat this process until only one contestant remains as the ultimate winner of the game. What is the winner’s number?_\n",

    "If we imagine a game with $n$ players for step $s$ (i.e. $f(n,s)=a$ where $a$ is the final remaining location), then after we've eliminated the first player, we have advanced $k$ spots and now have $n-1$ players. So the state of the board resembles the original state $f(n,s)$ if we started the $f(n,s)$ game $k$ steps forward (i.e. $f(n,s)+k$) and had one fewer player $(f(n-1,s)$). Together we intuitively have $f(n,s) = (f(n-1,s) + k) \\mod n$. Barring the indexing issue,  this intuition appears to bring us to the correct answer."

Of course, this formulation doesn't actually work because after the first round, $P(n)$'s predecessors aren't confined to $P(n-2)$ and $P(n-3)$.
