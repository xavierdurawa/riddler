    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model the problem as a graph traversal problem, much like last week's puzzle. The most obvious (in my opinion) way to do this is to represent each possible ordered triple (of which there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 12$) as a node, and draw a directed edge from node 1 to node 2 if the last two elements of node 1 equal the first two elements of node 2. Then we check if there's a Hamiltonian path (or, if there isn't, find the longest path admitted by the graph). This could work, but as best I can tell, there aren't any nice tidy theorems that tell us whether this graph has a Hamiltonian path (something like Dirac's theorem of Hamiltonicity). Instead, we would have to find a Hamiltonian path, probably with the help of a computer and a path-finding algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we format the graph a bit differently, we can easily show that there is a way to include all possible ordered triples in the shrub sequence. If we instead generate all possible ordered pairs of three elements and connect node 1 to node 2 if node 1's last element is equal to node 2's first element, then we have a graph where each edge represents the possible ordered triples. If we can find a path that spans all edges without reusing any, we can use all possible ordered triples, and our answer will be easy to compute. In other words, instead of searching for a Hamiltonian path, we're searching for an Eulerian path. We know that if every node of a directed graph has in-degree equal to out-degree, then there exists an Eulerian cycle, which implies an Eulerian path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully it's pretty clear that this pair-type graph has in-degree equal to out-degree for every vertex. There are a total of 6 pairs for a given vertex. A vertex will point to exactly two other nodes (out-degree), since the last element of the source vertex must equal the first element of the target vertex. By symmetry, the same is true for the in-degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can extend this reasoning for the cases when we're considering ordered sets of any size (not just 3). So if our requirement is that no $N$ consecutive shrubs appear more than once in a hedge, we can always construct a sequence that includes all possible ordered pairs of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that's left is to calculate the actual number of shrubs. This is easy. We start with $N$ shrubs for the first set of consecutive shrubs. Then we add 1 for each of the remaining distinct ordered sets. For an ordered set of size $N$ with replacement, it has size $N \\times (N - 1)^{N - 1}$. So our total is $N + N \\times (N - 1)^{N - 1} - 1$. For $N = 3$ that's $\\boxed{14}$, and for $N = 4$ that's $\\boxed{111}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below can prove computationally that such a path exists."
