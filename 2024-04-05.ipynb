    "I’m completing a paint-by-number painting, although this one is a little different from any that I’ve seen before. It’s an infinitely long strip of canvas that is 1 cm wide. It’s broken up into adjacent 1 cm-by-1 cm squares, each of which is numbered zero or one, each with a 50 percent chance. The squares are all numbered independently of each other. Every square with a zero I color red, while every square with a one I color blue.\n",

    "Once I’m done painting, there will be many “clusters” of contiguous red and blue squares. For example, consider the finite strip of canvas below. It contains 10 total squares and seven clusters, which means the average size of a cluster here is approximately 1.43 squares.\n",

    "To solve this, let's compute the size of an average cluster.  Let's first observe that in order for a new cluster to start, the current square has to be different than the previous square. This means that the probability of a new cluster starting is 0.5.  Starting from here, we can compute the expected number of squares in a cluster as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability of a cluster of size 1 is 0.5.\n",
    "- The probability of a cluster of size 2 is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.\n",
    "- The probability of a cluster of size 3 is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.125.\n",

    "Multiplying both sides by 1/2, we get:\n",
