    "\n",
    "_You’re doing a 30-minute workout on your stationary bike. There’s a live leaderboard that tracks your progress, along with the progress of everyone else who is currently riding, measured in units of energy called kilojoules. (For reference, one kilojoule is 1000 Watt-seconds.) Once someone completes their ride, they are removed from the leaderboard._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Suppose many riders are doing the 30-minute workout right now, and that they all begin at random times, with many starting before you and many starting after. Further suppose that they are burning kilojoules at different constant rates (i.e., everyone is riding at constant power) that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 200 Watts._\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of things to notice about the problem desctiption:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We're essentially comparing the energy expended by all active participants at a given time\n",
    "2. It says 'many rides' which I presume means an essentially infinite number of riders\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have an essentially infinite number of riders, being in the middle of the leaderboard means that we are directly in the middle of the distribution of energy expended by the typical rider which ammounts to when the CDF = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ E_i = P_i T_i $ Where $ P_i $ is the power and $ T_i $ is the time a rider has been riding. We know $ P_i $ is uniformly distributed between 0 and 200 Watts and $ T_i $ is uniformly distributed between 0 and 30 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the pdf of $ E_i $ we need to calculate the pdf of $ P_i $ and $ T_i $ and then convolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pdf of $ P_i $ is $ f_{P_i}(p) = \\frac{1}{200} $ for $ 0 \\leq p \\leq 200 $ and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pdf of $ T_i $ is $ f_{T_i}(t) = \\frac{1}{30} $ for $ 0 \\leq t \\leq 30 $ and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pdf of $ E_i $ is $ \\displaystyle f_{E_i}(e) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left| \\frac{1}{t} \\right| f_{P_i}(e/t) f_{T_i}(t) dt $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the bounds here. $ f_{P_i}(e/t) $ is non-zero only when $ e/t \\leq 200 \\rightarrow \\frac{e}{200} \\leq t $. $ f_{T_i}(t) $ is non-zero only when $ 0 \\leq t \\leq 30 $. Combining these we get $ \\frac{e}{200} \\leq t \\leq 30 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\displaystyle f_{E_i}(e) = \\frac{1}{30} \\int_{\\frac{e}{200}}^{30} \\frac{1}{t} \\frac{1}{200} dt = \\frac{1}{6000} \\int_{\\frac{e}{200}}^{30} \\frac{1}{t} dt = \\frac{1}{6000} \\ln(t) \\Big|_{\\frac{e}{200}}^{30} = \\frac{1}{6000} \\ln(30) - \\frac{1}{6000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{e}{200}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{30}{\\frac{e}{200}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{6000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{6000}{e}\\right) $ where $ 0 \\leq e \\leq 6000 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we find where the value $ P $ that, after 15 minutes, will put you in the middle of the leaderboard. This occurs when the CDF of $ E $ is 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\displaystyle \\int f_{E_i}(e) de = \\int \\frac{1}{6000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{6000}{e}\\right) de = \\frac{1}{6000} \\left( e \\ln\\left(\\frac{6000}{e}\\right) + e \\right) = 0.5$.\n",
