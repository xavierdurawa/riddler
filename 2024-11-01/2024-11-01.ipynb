However, two of these sides are curved (in particular, they are arcs of circles), and two of the right angles are exterior, meaning the interior angles measure 270 degrees (rather than the usual 90 degrees)._\n",

    "There's one important thing we can conlclude from the diagram, namely, the apex of the left [sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector) is colcated with the apex of the right arc. We know this because the straight line components of the wedge are perpendicular with the left arc, which is also true of the left arc's own radii, so the straigt segments 'extend' the radii of the left arc and imply that their centers' are colocated. \n",
